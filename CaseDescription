The Data Engineering Test Case that I have solved in October 2025.


The case Description:
Overview
The goal of this exercise is not to produce a final, production-ready solution but to
understand your approach to a real-world data project. We are looking for insights into
how you think about:
● Project Planning & Requirements: How do you translate a product brief into actionable
data engineering requirements? What questions would you ask to ensure alignment
with business needs?
● Data Engineering Principles: How would you design a scalable and efficient data
ingestion strategy for multiple marketing platforms?
● Analytics Engineering: How would you structure the data to make it reliable, usable,
and easily accessible for a business intelligence analyst using a tool like DBT?
The Scenario
You have been provided with an initial product brief from our Demand Generation team. They
need marketing insights to optimize their marketing spend.
They do have data on which campaigns are responsible for their leads, MQL opportunities,
etc. However, those insights are limited to a first or last-touch attribution model. To truly
understand which campaigns are contributing to new business sales bookings, they would
like to move to a Multi-touch-attribution model.
Paid platforms:
- Google Ads
- LinkedIn Ads
CRM/MAP/Analytics
- HubSpot
- Google Analytics
Data stack:
- DBT
- BigQuery (Google Cloud)
Your task is to review the provided brief and propose a high-level technical solution. Assume
we have DBT set up, but haven’t loaded any of the data sources yet.


Product Brief
Project Goal: Build a marketing model including Google Analytics data, Google Ads data and
LinkedIn data joined with a pipeline model from HubSpot.
Key Requirements (MoSCoW):
● Must: Track marketing-influenced revenue and AOV using a multi-touch attribution
model.
● Must: Integrate Google Ads, LinkedIn Ads, Google Analytics, and HubSpot data for a
holistic view.
● Should: Enable segmenting data by various dimensions
● Key Use Case:
○ Analyze marketing campaign performance and ROI.
Your Assignment
Please provide a detailed response addressing the following three sections.
Part 1: Project Planning & Requirements Analysis
Critique the provided product brief. From a data engineering perspective, what are the key
ambiguities or missing pieces of information?
What are the top 3-5 questions you would ask the Demand Generation team to clarify the
requirements before beginning any technical work? Explain why each question is critical for
the success of this project.
How would you approach defining the success criteria for this project beyond the initial use
cases?
Part 2: Data Ingestion Strategy
Propose a high-level data ingestion strategy to get the data from the source systems (GAds,
Google Analytics 4, LinkedIn Ads, HubSpot) into a central data warehouse (e.g., BigQuery).
Outline your recommended approach and justify your choice. Include details on the type of
data loading (e.g., full vs. incremental loads, batch vs. streaming) and how you would handle
data from each of the three sources.
Briefly describe a high-level architecture diagram (you can use text to represent this, e.g.,
Source -> Ingestion method -> Data Warehouse)

Part 3: Data Transformation & Analytics Layer
Describe your approach to modeling this data for the final dashboard using a tool like DBT.
The goal is to create a reliable and well-organized data model that an analyst can easily query
without needing to understand the underlying raw data.
Describe and explain the DBT models you would build to support the use cases in the brief.
For each model, specify its purpose, the tables it would join, and the key logic it would contain
(e.g., calculating ROAS).
Finally, convert your approach to a proof-of-concept DBT repository.
Deliverables
We expect the following deliverables as part of your assessment:
● Project Planning & Requirements Analysis (Part 1):
A written response detailing your critique, clarifying questions, and success criteria.
● Data Ingestion Strategy (Part 2):
A written response outlining your proposed strategy, justification, loading approach,
and a high-level architecture diagram (text-based).
● Data Transformation & Analytics Layer (Part 3):
○ A written response describing your DBT modeling approach, including purpose,
joins, and key logic for each model.
○ A proof-of-concept DBT repository (e.g., a GitHub link or a zip file) containing your
DBT models. You do not need to populate it with actual data, but the structure and
logic should be clear.
